        name: 'Eaz-Lift 48783 ReCurve R6 Weight Distribution Hitch, 800 lb., 15K - Features Adaptive Sway Control Making Manuevering Smoother and Easier on the Driver and a 1,000 lb. Maximum Tongue Weight Rating',
        description:
          'The Eaz-Lift ReCurve R6 is our most user-friendly weight distribution hitch. It has a 1, 000 lb. maximum tongue weight rating with premium adaptive sway control. With other sway control hitches, turning can be an even bigger hassle than it usually is with a trailer because the sway control “locks” the trailer straight. With the ReCurve R6, the hitch will control your sway for normal driving, but when you turn, the sway control will automatically disengage, making maneuvering smoother and easier on the driver. The sway control can easily be turned completely off in dangerous or icy road conditions. Its top-loading spring bars give it more ground clearance than other weight distribution hitches, and the streamlined design makes the hitch and the trailer move as one, while creating a sleek and subtle look. Includes a 2-5/16-inch hitch ball with a 15, 000 lb. maximum rating. Maximum gross vehicle weight rating: 10, 000 lb. The included brackets accommodate trailers with 3-inch to 6-inch A-frames. ',
